# Installation On Edge

### The Edge builds are highly experimental, it *will* break on a regular basis. 

### Please report problems you encounter, even minor ones. 

I don't use the Edge builds actively and I can't fix bugs that I'm not aware of. 

## Installation

1. Download build(s) from the [release page](https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore/releases) and extract it. Both Nano Adblocker 
and Nano Defender are located there. 

2. Open Edge, open `Settings` pannel, scroll all the way down, you should see a version number that is at least `40.15063.674.0`. 
If not, you need to first update Windows.

3. Enter the page `about:flags` and check `Enable extension developer features`. 

4. Restart Edge, open `Extensions` pannel, click `Load extension` button to side load the extracted package(s) from step 1. 

Note that Edge will disable side loaded extensions on every start.

### We have submitted Nano Adblocker to Microsoft Store, although the review can take months.
