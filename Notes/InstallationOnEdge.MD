# Installation On Edge

### The Edge build is highly experimental, it *will* break on a regular basis. 

1. Download a build from [release page](https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore/releases)

2. Update Windows, open `Settings` pannel, scroll all the way down, you should see a version number that is at least `40.15063.674.0`.

3. Enter the page `about:flags` and enable `Enable extension developer features`. 

4. Restart Edge, open `Extensions` pannel, click `Load extension` button to side load extensions. 

Keep in mind that Edge will disable side loaded extensions on every start.
