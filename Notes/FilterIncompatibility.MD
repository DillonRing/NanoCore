# Filter Incompatibility

Nano Adblocker and uBlock Origin share a lot of filters, however, there are some differences in how filters are handled. 

## Extra Resources

Nano Adblocker has [extra resources](https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoFilters/blob/master/NanoFilters/NanoResources.txt), 
when a filter reference one of these resources, it will not work as intended in uBlock Origin out of the box. You can load those 
extra resources with advanced settings.
