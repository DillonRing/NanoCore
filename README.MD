# Nano Adblocker Core

Just another adblocker

Nano Adblocker is based on [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

Please open an issue if there is something you want us to know.

This repository contains the legacy code of Nano Adblocker, the new code can be
found in the
[Nano Core 2 repository](https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore2).

*Chrome Web Store approves new builds **within seconds** but Microsoft Store
takes weeks for a new version to be published, so the Edge version will be
somewhat behind and that is out of my control.*
